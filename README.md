Secure Password Generator

Overview
	This is a simple script written in Python to generate secure random passwords. 
	The script utilizes the secrets module to ensure a higher level of security compared to the random module.

Features
	* Secure: Uses the secrets module to generate cryptographically secure random passwords.
	* Customizable Length: Allows users to specify the desired length of the generated password.
	* Validation: Validates user input to ensure it is a valid positive integer for password length.
	* User-Friendly: Provides clear prompts and error messages for ease of use.

Prerequisites
	* Python 3.x

Usage
	1. Clone the repository:
			git clone https://github.com/mamishega/secure_password_generator.git
	2. Run the script:
 			python secure_password_generator.py
  	3. Follow the prompts to enter the desired password length.
 	 4. The script will generate and display a secure random password.
	 
How it Works
	1. The script prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password.
	2. It validates the input to ensure it is a positive integer.
	3. Using the secrets module, a random password is generated by selecting characters from the combination of ASCII letters and digits.
	4. The generated password is displayed to the user.

 Example

	Secure Password Generator
	Please enter the length of the password: 12
	Generated Password: aB3fG2hI8jK

Error Handling
The script includes error handling to address invalid user inputs. 
If the user enters a non-positive integer for the password length, a `ValueError` is raised, and an appropriate error message is displayed.
