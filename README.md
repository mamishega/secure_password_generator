# Secure Password Generator

## Overview

This is a simple script written in Python to generate secure random passwords. The script utilizes the `secrets` module to ensure a higher level of security compared to the `random` module.

## Features

- **Secure:** Uses the `secrets` module to generate cryptographically secure random passwords.
- **Customizable Length:** Allows users to specify the desired length of the generated password.
- **Validation:** Validates user input to ensure it is a valid positive integer for password length.
- **User-Friendly:** Provides clear prompts and error messages for ease of use.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-password-generator.git
   cd secure-password-generator
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python secure_password_generator.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter the desired password length.

4. The script will generate and display a secure random password.

## How it Works

1. The script prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password.
2. It validates the input to ensure it is a positive integer.
3. Using the `secrets` module, a random password is generated by selecting characters from the combination of ASCII letters and digits.
4. The generated password is displayed to the user.

## Example

```bash
Secure Password Generator
Please enter the length of the password: 12
Generated Password: aB3fG2hI8jK
```

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to address invalid user inputs. If the user enters a non-positive integer for the password length, a `ValueError` is raised, and an appropriate error message is displayed.
